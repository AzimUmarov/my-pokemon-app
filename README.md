## Task
Create a multiple page Pokemon game application with ReactJS.

## Description
First page display all the pokemons and second page shows details of current pokemon
Also needs search bar for filter pokemons and need error handler(lost connection, bad request)
We use external api.

In my Application,
You can see pokemons in first page with pagination  20 pokemons per page
with its name,  abilities and number.
You can see search and pagination bar on the navbar
search bar helps to find pokemon from the current page
And if you click the pokemon shows specific details of the pokemon with tab layout card in modal window
you can switch between About, Base stats and moves
and you can exit the window with click outside the card(window)

Error handler works if API don't respond or you have slow connection and you can see error handler by quickly clicking button pagination next :)

I use bootstrap for styling the project also w3School CSS styles for tab layout in the modal window (https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css)
and of course https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
